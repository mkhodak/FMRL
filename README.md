# FMRL

This repository contains code and scripts to recreate the task-similarity, quadratic growth, and deep learning experiments from the FMRL paper (citation below).

* task-similarity: <tt>similarity.py</tt>
* quadratic growth: <tt>growth.py</tt>
* deep learning: <tt>.sh</tt> scripts in <tt>reptile</tt> directory (edited clone of OpenAI's [Reptile codebase](https://github.com/openai/supervised-reptile))
* MiniWiki dataset: <tt>.tar.gz</tt> file in <tt>data/</tt>
